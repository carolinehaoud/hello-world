<h2>Here are some resources I will be using during this journey (so I don't forget) </h2>

<p>freecodecamp (im not really a fan of the tuition based bootcamps, feels like a scam / predatory from what I've read. Not-for-profits like freecodecamp are really great for providing the same education regardless of your financial resources)

visual studio code (we love open source software here)

figma (recently got into a club at school that uses figma for UI/UX design, really excited about learning about front-end development)</p>
